Define the questions and answers for your quiz. You can do this by creating an array of objects, where each object represents a question and its corresponding answer(s).

Create the HTML structure for your quiz. You can do this by creating a form element and adding a series of div elements to display the questions and answer choices. Each answer choice should be represented by a radio button. 

Add a JavaScript function to handle the submission of the quiz form. This function should iterate over the questions and answers, check if the selected answer is correct, and keep track of the number of correct answers.

This should give you a basic quiz app that allows users to select an answer for each question and displays the number of correct answers upon submission. You can customize the app further by adding additional features, such as a timer or a leaderboard.
